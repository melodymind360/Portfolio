    <h2>This is a project I did for the cane I inherited from my grandfather. The bottom of the cane was lost so I decided to 3D print a new end for the cane using Orca slicer.</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The process of making the cane end included me to first measure the diameter of the bottom of my cane along with measuring the thread by comparing it other threads i did know the size of to figure out which one would fit, then I had to design it in a CAD software named solidworks using the measurements I took. After I designed it I printed it, sanded it down a little and applyeed it to the end of my can</p>
