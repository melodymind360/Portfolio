    <h2>The air enginge was a project I had to do for Cherry Creek Innovation Center my junior year of high school for my cnc machining 2 class. It involved me to work with 4 other people to creat a machine that when you put pressurized air in it, it would move like an engine spinning lever.</h2>
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The highlited parts are the ones I made. The total process of making the machine included working with others assigning who makes what parts
        , then I had to make the parts in a CAD sofware using the drawings provided, then created a CAM program to create both parts on a HATHS CNC mills
        , i then measured the parts to make sure they were within tolerance, then assembled it with the other parts made by my teammates.
